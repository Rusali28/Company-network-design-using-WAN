# Company-network-design-using-WAN

In this project, we have made an attempt to connect the servers of a Multi National Company across three countries - UK, USA and India.
WAN – Wide Area Network is a communication network that makes use of existing
technology to connect local area networks into a larger working network which may
cover both national and international locations.

Wide Area Network allows a company to make use of common resources in order to
operate, internal functions such as sales, production, development, marketing and
accounting can be shared with authorized locations through this sort of network
application. So that’s why it is so important today.

For our implementation we have used a Wide Area Network and integrated it with the following Computer Network Protocols:
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
- DNS (Domain Name Server)
- HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
- NTP (Network Time Protocol)
- Syslog (System Logging Protocol)
